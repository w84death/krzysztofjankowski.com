<p>For years I was using MacBooks as my primary computers for everything. But as I gain experience in Linux I started to use more open/free software. Here are my current setup both in hardware and software. It’s definitely not final and I still perfecting it.</p>

<p><img src="assets/centeroftheworld.jpg" alt="centeroftheworld" title="" /></p>

<h4>Hardware</h4>

<p>When I’m outdoor I mostly use only the laptop. But when I’m home  or doing some 48h hackathon I use all of those:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dell 7204 Rugged Extreme (i5/8/256)</li>
<li>Dell P1914S (4:3, 1280x1024)</li>
<li>Vortex Poker III (keyboard with Cherry MX Browns)</li>
<li>Kensington Orbit (trackball)</li>
</ul>

<p>The best part is that Dell 7204 have touch screen that can be flipped and the whole laptop can transform into (rather bulky) tablet. For pixel artist this is a dream machine. I no longer need to bringing my Wacom tablet anymore! Also touch in linux is now supported very well so I use my fingers a lot in day-to-day situations too.</p>

<p>I really like the 4:3 monitors. They’re small on desk but have lot of working space. They have the best medium to edit A4 documents. Or any code. Or photos. They are just perfect.</p>

<p>For any coder good keyboard is a main accessory. Mechanical keyboards are what I really need to do lot of writing. I choose Pok3r because it’s 60% keyboard - small but have all the buttons I really use.</p>

<p>Lot of peoples ask me about trackball - why I use it, is it better, etc… What I can say? I really don’t know. I never use any so I just bought one to test if it’s something for me or not. Turns out I fall in love from day one :) But to this day I can not say why. I just like to use it.</p>

<h4>Software</h4>

<p>This is the place where I constantly find something new. The last thing that I relay on that’s not free nor open is Adobe Photoshop.</p>

<h5>Base</h5>

<p>Standard linux setup. I use Debian-based distros for some time but when I discovered Arch I never get back. For windows management I love XFCE as it's fast and essential. But now, as I have touchscreen the only enviroment that supports it is GNOME. And GNOME is really fine. But slow...</p>

<ul>
<li>Linux (Arch/Antergos)</li>
<li>GNOME (best for touch monitors)</li>
</ul>

<h5>Development</h5>

<p>Nothing spectacular in this area. I use vim/nano when doing console based stuff. But to do actual code there is nothing better than Sublime!</p>

<ul>
<li>Godot Engine</li>
<li>SublimeText 3</li>
<li>Git (Terminal/GitKraken)</li>
<li>gFTP</li>
</ul>

<h5>Graphics</h5>

<p>I have Adobe CC licence for my MacBooks (Photoshop&amp;Lightroom) but on Linux there is no alternative. Happily CS2 works in Wine good enough so I can now do all my work on Linux machine.</p>

<ul>
<li>Adobe Photoshop CS2 @Wine (main tool)</li>
<li>Aseprite (pixel art)</li>
<li>Scribus (print stuff)</li>
<li>FontForge (fonts)</li>
<li>Blender (modeling/rendering)</li>
</ul>
