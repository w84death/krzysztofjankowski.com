Updated Software and Hardware Stack

Over the years I'm changing hardware and software to create my perfect setup. Hardware those days are not changing that fast. Today 5 year old computer is more than good. But software is rapidly updating and new created. Also my switch to Linux makes this even more dynamic as I yet not know everything and still learning this awesome OS.

## Hardware

- Dell Rugged Extreme (7204) i5/8GB/256 SSD/touch screen
- Dell P1914S (5:4, 1280x1024)
- Vortex Pok3r (mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Browns)
- Kensington Orbit (trackball)

This did not change. It's still the best laptop I own. I can use it in the shower (water proof) or throw it to the ground (shock proof). And the Pok3r keyboard with brown switches is superb. I do a lot of coding/writing and can't see doing this without mechanical keyboard.

- Sonim 3300 (rugged phone)
- FiiO X3 (HiFi music player)
- Grado SR 80e (headphones)

I don't need smartphone - I have enough computers around me. And I need rugged phone. Sonim is one of the best and it's indestructible. As of music I'm a little audiophile and FiiO/Grado gives me the best sound I can imagine.
